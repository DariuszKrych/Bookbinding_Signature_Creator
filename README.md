# Bookbinding_Signature_Creator
Takes an input of a 2 column pdf book file. Can add numbering to the pages. Can shuffle the pages around creating separate complete signature files for the input pdf book.

I wanted to create signatures for 12 separate books for some bookbinding hobby stuff and it seemed like more fun to write this than to do it manually and it saved me time. XD

## Requirements
The python script requires a Python 3.12 environment with the pydpf & reportlab libraries.

## Sidenote
I'll polish the code up a bit to make it more user friendly.
Then I might add a GUI, we'll see. :)
